* Emission of emissive blocks is reduced if snow is on top
* Transparency of translucent blocks is reduced when snow is on top
* Snow doesn't generate if near a light source or if under blocks (it still generates below blocks like glass, unfortunately not fixable)
* The resolution or noise size can be configured. Options are 16x, 32x, 64x and 128x. Default is 16x
* An option to change the snow noise intensity exists which makes the noise more or less apparent
